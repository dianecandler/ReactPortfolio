# About the Design
 * Goal was to come as close as I could to creating a living, self-guided resume of my work.
 * Heavily component driven program, making it simple to modify or pull parts for new endeavors.  React is ideal.  This will be important as my experience grows.
 * Designed to showcase my creativity while providing an entertainly way to review my projects, experience, and learn more about the highly self-motivated person I am.
 * Inspired by a template not written for React.  Required I convert the template to use with React and also allow for greater creativity using other bootstrap.
 * Greatest challenge?  Understanding unfamiliar code, re-writing, and creating a template of my own.

# About this Portfolio 
A place to showcase samples of my coding creations while providing background on my product management, consulting, home design and
historic restoration business, and highlight my active volunteer commitments.  Inside the program are lots of images, samples of my
work, links to my resume/CV, logos from some of the non-profits I've served as a board member or trainer, and testimonials from those who know me and my work.  

 * Portfolio is currently hosted on Heroku. Please be patient with load time!
 * Links to my GitHub and LinkedIn sites.
 * View my resume, accessed through an icon link to a pdf file.

# Testimonials
 * Added one enterprise work manager, one consultant company, one design client
 * With time will update and add others to keep website fresh
