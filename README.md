# React Portfolio by Diane Candler

Simple and entertaining way to view my projects and job experience. 

This portfolio is so much more than a repository!  Let me know what you think.

* Heroku App (https://dianecandler.herokuapp.com/)
* GitHub (https://github.com/dianecandler/ReactPortfolio)

# About the Design
 * Goal was to come as close as I could to creating a living, self-guided resume of my work.
 * Heavily component driven program, making it simple to modify or pull parts for new endeavors.  React is ideal.  This will be important as my experience grows.
 * Designed to showcase my creativity while providing an entertainly way to review my projects, experience, and learn more about the highly self-motivated person I am.
 * Inspired by a template not written for React.  Required I convert the template to use with React and also allow for greater creativity using other bootstrap.
 * Greatest challenge?  Understanding unfamiliar code, re-writing, and creating a template of my own.

# About this Portfolio
A place to showcase samples of my coding creations while providing background on my product management, consulting, home design & historic restoration business, and highlight my active volunteer commitments.  Inside the program are lots of images, samples of my work, links to my resume/CV, logos from some of the non-profits I've served as a board member or trainer, and testimonials from those who know me and my work.  

 * Portfolio is currently hosted on Heroku. Please be patient with load time!
 * Links to my GitHub and LinkedIn sites.
 * View my resume, accessed through an icon link to a pdf file.

# Testimonials
* Added one enterprise work manager, one consultant company, one design client
* With time will update and add others to keep website fresh
