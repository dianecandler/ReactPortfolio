# Created React Template
Fell in love with a website template but it wasn't designed for React. That didn't stop me from going to work to convert all into a React-ready template.

Biggest challenges began with understanding the code and all that was required to build the new template. For example the CSS was just easier to pull into multiple folders for React. Some of the syntax was written in JavaScript and needed to work with React. There is still some work to do on the timing but it works and the end product looks very similar to the website I wanted to model mine after.

##  Tools and Languages
* React
* HTML
* CSS Bootstrap - converted to React
* Git Hub 
* Heroku

## Visibility
* Important to allow both standard and reactive mode to ensure the content if visible for any user.
* Invoking serviceWorker to allow for loading without internet connectivity.

## Lessons Learned
* When calling image files, this does not require the dot (./) but does require the extension (.png).
* Revising bootstrap to create a React document requires great attention to detail.  Error messages proved helpful in catching the changes needed from 'class' to 'className'.
* Significant forklift effort from previous portfolio as a result of the template creation.  Well worth the time and effort required.
* May want to invest in better image manipulation software to improve results and minimize time spent.
* Sticky headers and footers simplify development challenges and yield a clean user experience.

# ServiceWorker
This is my first experience with ServiceWorker which once registered and installed will allow running this program without internet connectivity.  What's not to appreciate. 

Matt Gaunt wrote, "A service worker is a script that your browser runs in the background, separate from a web page, opening the door to features that don't need a web page or user interaction." and "The reason this is such an exciting API is that it allows you to support offline experiences, giving developers complete control over the experience."
