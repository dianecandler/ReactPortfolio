# ServiceWorker
This is my first experience with ServiceWorker which once registered and installed will allow running this program without internet connectivity.  What's not to appreciate. 

Matt Gaunt wrote, "A service worker is a script that your browser runs in the background, separate from a web page, opening the door to features that don't need a web page or user interaction." and "The reason this is such an exciting API is that it allows you to support offline experiences, giving developers complete control over the experience."

# Created React Template
Fell in love with this website template but it wasn't designed for React.  That didn't stop me from getting help in order to convert this (http://paul-themes.com/html/simone/home-personal.html?storefront=envato-elements#) into a React-ready template. 

Biggest challenges began with understanding the code and all that was required to build the new template.  For example the CSS was just easier to pull into multiple folders for React.  Some of the syntax was written in JavaScript and needed to work with React.  There is still some work to do on the timing but it works and the end product looks very similar to the website I wanted to model mine after.
